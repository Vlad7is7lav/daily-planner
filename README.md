<h3> Description </h3>

At the beginning, this project was conceived as a regular to-do list, but the thoughts kept popping up that these are too usual. 
Then I decided to add a calendar that help to write to-do list in different days and user can save if login.
  
<h3> Technology stack </h3>
HTML5 SCSS Webpack JavaScript Node Express Mongoose 

<h3> How to use </h3>
- You can use it both when you logged-in or logged-out. But if you don't login you can't save to-do-list.
<br/>
- At the start you should select a day, then write a title for your list and create. 
You can write no more than 17 tasks.
<br/>
- If you want you can edit task or delete. Also you can delete all list.
<br/>
- "Completed" and "Active" buttons help you to filter your tasks, it can be very convenient.
<br/>
- When you crate your task you will see the yellow mark on the calendar. This gives a clear understanding of what day you have the to-do-list for.
